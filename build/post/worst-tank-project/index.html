The main theme of this gamejam was  **You are the enemy** which was first very confusing and we had literally no idea what to even do.
We were first planning on making a game where you have to kill yourself through a mirror, But it sounded very wrong so we decided to drop having living things in game.

<br>
Having material things to break and explode made it much more interesting so we thought of making a game where you play as a drone and try to shoot yourself by ricocheting off of walls.
