# Happy new year 2K25

My Year in Review for 2k25!!

Alot of things have happened in the past 4 months, Firstly I got into a new organisation! My very first** job change. I am still awaiting full onboarding as of time of starting this blog. With the new organisation being work from office, It will be a different change for me, More Extrovert-y! 

So many things happened this year that its just felt like I am back in 2019's where things actually happened in an year, unlike monotonous times post covid era!

Major thing that happened this year was, I am now well.. LGBTQ.

## Being not straight!

I was diagnosed with Gender Incongruence and I am currently on HRT.

Would really like to thank [Dr Aana Shah](https://www.draanashah.com/), she was extremely helpful and I've gotten my GID and Endo recommendations from her.

## ~~Job Switching~~

I am sure this isnt a major resolution but I really needed to get away from that workplace which was eating my sanity.

**-- Update --**

I Doubled down on Job switching this year..! Literally..!

I resigned __ZIGRAM__ in March and joined __Infracloud__ (Due to logistics of me working at their client location of _NPCI_ I had to resign again).

I joined __JP Morgan Chase__ in Nov! Wohoo!

## Photography 

I bought a Sony Camera in June, It made me realise how amazing taking photos feels, rather than just point and click.

## Travel

Some of the cool trips and vacations I did this year! (๑>◡<๑).

#### - Kolkata, India (March)

I've visited Kolkata with `Temp_block` to meet `Ruby`, This was a very adhoc trip ... ngl I wasn't so keen on this trip, Overall Kolkata has really good food wowie .. and is polluted as hell!

#### - Mumbai & Pune, India (March)

This was an amazing trip where I got to meet some discord friends, basically this became my anti introvert trip! after the mess of a kolkata trip! and I got to meet [Swasti!!](https://www.youtube.com/@Swasti1)

#### - Mahabhaleshwar (June) ~ Infracloud 

 I was taken for year end celebration by a company I joined Improving (Formerly called Infracloud), Well This was an annual get together sorta party... Got to experience a corpo party lol waoh!


#### - Thailand and Singapore (November)

A stupidly adhoc plan with a person I met very recently _Pallavi_, Was in middle of switching from Improving to JPMC... so why not go on a vacation! annnn...d MIKU CONCERT OMGawsh!!!!

## Family Abuse!

<details>
<summary><i> <i>Sensitive</i> [click to open] </i></summary>

I realised one thing this year... is that my parents (and maybe my brother?) are abusive. Shocker that I haven't really considered or realised. How much self hatred they have put in me to the point, I hate myself. Slowly changing this ofcourse, self love is really needed for someone's well being.

Few things that still bother me is how they mention that I am disrespectful when I wasn't given respect to begin with! I still have no clue what love as an emotion means or feels yet they throw things like "Oh we loved you and fed you for 20+ years ... is this how you treat us"

Literal negligence on their side instead of resolving conflicts, its just silence or backbitching insults, Aunts coming to home to threaten me on police cases. Being called *Pathetic*, *Ugly*, *Disgusting*, *Demonic/Inhuman*, *Homeless*, Being told how I'll lose my job and come running back to them for money.

I probably shoudn't be putting this out on a blog but this is one of the serious major things that happened with me this year.

Anyhow.. This was one heck of an year.. alot of new year resolutions were actually completed omg and I am proud of myself.
