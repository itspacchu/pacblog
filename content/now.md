So alot of things happened this past half month since I last updated the /now.

### Firstly ...

I got put into work at JPMC and it was to be really honest a bit mundane ... maybe expected cause I'm still learning alot of things here, Still getting used to solving those tickets and learning more about the infra and stuff at the organisation, and hell dealing with users!

### Secondly...

<summary><i>[SENSITIVE] I came out to my parents!!</i></summary>

**This is huge** I uhm got outed by my dad for being too womenly. So at JPMC we have a mandatory full body health checkup thingy where they gendered me as female in the final reports (I havent told them anything... I passed? Euphoria?) so my dad saw those things and told me bunch of not so good things. I told him I am Enby and asked both the parents to come to Psychiatrist.


Today (17th Jan 2026) they came with me and had a talk with Dr Aana Shah (The same Psychiatrist I've visited last year regarding all the documents) well -
Dad told me _Do what you want but I won't be helping you in anything_, 
whilst Mom went complete nuts and told me _I've wasted 25 years of my life and you give me this bad news_.

Well my mom said that she lost opportunity to work as a teacher cause she was pregnant with me, and blames her lack of career on me.
She considered kililng me during pregancy (ABORTION, that is the sentence she used to tell me calling me demonic and disgusting).

So yeah I've been told I am complete failure... a Dissapointment and bunch of other things.
