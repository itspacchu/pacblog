## Happy new year 2K25

> 4 months into 2025

My first ~~public~~ blogpost for 2025!

Alot of things have happened in the past 4 months, Firstly I got into a new organisation! My very first job change. I am still awaiting full onboarding as of time of writing this blogpost. With the new organisation being work from office, I will be experiencing new things this year

- Moving out of my parents house!
- Office culture and life

and many more...

## Resolutions

I did make some resolutions 

### ~~Job Switching~~

I am sure this isnt a major resolution but I really needed to get away from that workplace which was eating my sanity.

### Piano

Want to relearn piano to play alot of music. I have been obsessed with music which has been keeping me sane during alot of things.
