Fourier Series is a mathematical technique that is used to approximate the shape of a curve by decomposing signal into frequency components.


``` Complex Fourier Series ```

<b>Attempt #1 :</b> Havent done much except trying to pick out a backend to work this thing on ... thought of using <b>Cinema4D</b> but due to lack of its precision on floating point integers coudn't get it to work with my initial values
<br>

<br>
And here's me messing with Cinema4D with rotating circles.

<b>Attempt #2 :</b> Well i decided to come back to blender-python. and found an amazing tutorial on youtube <i>( It was in p5.js )</i>,
I didnt realise i could loop the entire thing instead of pre-stacking parametric equations in addition really impressive i must say :).

<br>
So now all i need to do is find fourier coefficients which i already have a script for in python ^^ above :> and merge them into this one.
Cheerios <b>#Day2</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Attempt #2 cont :</b> I got the result but coudn't draw anything useful except basic signals due to memory limitation but its cool to see them drawing,
This challenge was really cool ... i learnt a lot :D
