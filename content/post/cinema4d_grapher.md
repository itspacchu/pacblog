<h2> Cinema4D Math Graphing using Matrix plane building </h2>
<br>a
This is a simple test project i wanted to build ... to generate 3D XY plots in Cinema4D.

<h3> How does it work? </h3>

A plane is generated with z = 0 if we iterate through the x and y axes ...
by injecting a function and taking the corresponding Z value we can basically plot stuff in cinema4D (I know thats how basically every graphing thing works)
