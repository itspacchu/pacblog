Greetings guardians,

I gave a talk at Microsoft! in collaboration with MJCET University in Hyderabad. I was recommended by [Shahbaaz Khan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahbaaz-khan-262448188/) to present a talk on `Software Development Lifecycle`, Essentially a talk on Devops and a brief overview on how things are done in Devops-yy world.

I had invited my fellow Devops underling [Lekha Grace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manchala-lekha-7b31251b4/),
