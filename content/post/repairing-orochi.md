Greetings Humans,

I have been using Razer Orochi V2 for quite some time, Its a great compact mouse for work (and gaming ofc :>) Due to some some issue the scroll wheel stopped working and it glitches out while using, So me being me decided to straight up open it and look inside.

I had little bit of experience repairing mouses when I got my Logitech G102 where is constantly had double clicking issues.
