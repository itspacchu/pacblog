Greetings humans,
I have dissapeared for a very long time ... last post was back in [E paper Kiosk : 2022-08-28](/post/e-paper-kiosk/)

I've been dealing with alot of stuff that happened in the year of 2023; Firstly I got a JOB ... In this economy of layoffs and all I somehow was lucky enough to get one although not in my field *Devops Engineer* still something that interests me, As this blog and all the infrastructure I have keeping this website running is my passion project.

The new work being a corporate job, I was trying to learn how to fix my schedules (As its fully Remote) I have completly wrecked my sleep schedule and my daily cycling habit which I have started in 2020 was shattered, I have been seriously addicted to playing games like Overwatch 2 and Destiny which led to Stupidly insane amount of time being wasted ... maybe not wasted as I did have some fun but nevertheless Hours of time just spent playing the same matches and stuff felt like a chore more than having fun.

So 2023 was entirely spent on learning alot of things related to my new work field such as `Kubernetes`, `Terraform`, `Ansible` and other stuff. So yeah... pretty cool stuff.

Another thing that happened in Late 2023, Early 2024 was Oracle Free tier account of mine being deleted. This website was hosted as a container on the Free tier ARM instances.

Currently this server is running on a kubernetes cluster on my homelab setup.
