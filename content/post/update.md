## Where u at :O

Greetings humans,
I have dissapeared for a very long time ... last post was back in [E paper Kiosk : 2022-08-28](/post/e-paper-kiosk/)

I've been dealing with alot of stuff that happened in the year of 2023; Firstly I got a JOB ... In this economy of layoffs and all I somehow was lucky enough to get one although not in my field *Devops Engineer* still something that interests me, As this blog and all the infrastructure I have keeping this website running is my passion project.

### What I've been doing

The new work being a corporate job, I was trying to learn how to fix my schedules (As its fully Remote) I have completly wrecked my sleep schedule and my daily cycling habit which I have started in 2020 was shattered, I have been seriously addicted to playing games like Overwatch 2 and Destiny which led to Stupidly insane amount of time being wasted ... maybe not wasted as I did have some fun but nevertheless Hours of time just spent playing the same matches and stuff felt like a chore more than having fun.

So 2023 was entirely spent on learning alot of things related to my new work field such as `Kubernetes`, `Terraform`, `Ansible` and other stuff. So yeah... pretty cool stuff.

So 2024 was me basically realising how much time I have wasted due to lack of motivation, [I found out this happens due to low Vitamin D](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-breakthrough-depression-solution/201111/psychological-consequences-vitamin-d-deficiency).
I have decided to change and have gotten my first certification CKA :D

### Vlogging adventures

> [Checkout the seperate page on vlogs](/vlogs)

I have started travelling between cities for events especially _Bengaluru_, here are the vlogs for two times I've visited Bengaluru.

### Homelabbing Adventures

Another thing that happened in Late 2023, Early 2024 was Oracle Free tier account of mine being deleted. This website was hosted as a container on the Free tier ARM instances.

Currently this server is running on a kubernetes cluster on my homelab setup.

```
HOMELAB
├── homelab.local (Raspberry Pi 4)
├── pi3dev.local (Raspberry Pi 3)
└── pidev.local (Raspberry Pi 4)
```

Cloudflare tunnels to proxy from home network to well [prashantnook.in](https://prashantnook.in).

I am currently writing a post regarding my homelab setup where I will be going about this in more detail. 

## Future plans?

Currently I have a bunch of plans which I want to try and bunch of abandonned projects which needs some revival.

### Bunch of plans

- Learning Golang
   >  Since Most of all the tools and stuff in devops are written in golang I'd like be able to contribute to some of them in future

- Out of India trips ( Hong Kong )
    > I want to explore places outside India , Recently I've met an amazingly cool person who I would love to meet and explore the Urbanscape of Hong Kong and Shenzen (Electornics bby)

### Bunch of abandonned projects

- Rewriting [pacchubot](https://github.com/itspacchu/pacchubot) in golang
    > This comes as a plan to learn golang, This seems like the best place to play around with APIs and building stuff.

- Building an FPV Drone
    > This has been a project which was in my mind since a very long time... during the chip shortage I was unable to find components and lack of money :<

- Self built Networked Multiplayer game
    > I've always wanted to build a multiplayer game, I would like to learn how networking works in depth mainly in multiplayer games.

Thats all I've got for now, Stay tuned for the homelab blog post or video :>
