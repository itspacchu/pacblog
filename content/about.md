Hello everyone, I am Prashant. A complete stranger on the internet who is an undergrad Electronics and Communications major and likes to tinker with stuff.
Here in this blog you'll find my random curious experiments and simulations which I like to do sometimes, Hope they are enjoyable to read and play through as much I had fun making them.
