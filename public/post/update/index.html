<p>The new work being a corporate job, I was trying to learn how to fix my schedules (As its fully Remote) I have completly wrecked my sleep schedule and my daily cycling habit which I have started in 2020 was shattered, I have been seriously addicted to playing games like Overwatch 2 and Destiny which led to Stupidly insane amount of time being wasted &hellip; maybe not wasted as I did have some fun but nevertheless Hours of time just spent playing the same matches and stuff felt like a chore more than having fun.</p>
<p>So 2023 was entirely spent on learning alot of things related to my new work field such as <code>Kubernetes</code>, <code>Terraform</code>, <code>Ansible</code> and other stuff. So yeah&hellip; pretty cool stuff.</p>
